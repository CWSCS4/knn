# knn
K-nearest-neighbors with numpy, from an assignment at Stanford's CS231n

Please cd into cs231n/datasets directory and run the get_datasets.sh script there, to download the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Then open knn.ipynb in Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions! You will also need to modify `cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py`.
